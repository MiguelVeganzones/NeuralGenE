## make a higher order function that generates mutation policies and evolve agents and mutation policies simultaneously

agents share a static mutation policy generator that creates a new policy based on current parameters and a mutation policy.

Agents will have their own mutation policy then

The reproduction guide will contain a metric for the distamce between memebrs.
    using agent_norm_calculator_type   = distance_matrix_type (*)(generation_container_type const&);

## Unit tests
## create a nullable type
